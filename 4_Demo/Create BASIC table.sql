 INDICATIONS:   63 y/o man with confusion, status post MVA presenting with head
 lacerations and confusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the brain were obtained without contrast.

 FINDINGS:  There are multiple small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage at the
 [**Doctor Last Name 180**] white matter interface.  In addition, there is intraventricular
 hemorrhage present and a tiny subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal
 sulci. There is a prominent amount of white matter hypdensity.  Old lacunar
 infarcts are seen in the basal ganglia. There is no evidence of mass effect or
 shift of normally midline structures.

 The visualized osseous structures reveal no fractures.  The sphenoid sinus
 wall is thickened and sclerotic appearing.  These findings were conveyed to
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 1:30 p.m. on [**3020-11-10**].

 HISTORY: MVA, abdominal distention.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained after
 the administration of 150 cc of Optiray per fast bolus technique.

 Sagittal reformations were performed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The aorta is partially calcified. There is
 no evidence of acute thoracic injury. The pulmonary vessels are unremarkable.
 The heart is slightly enlarged. There is no evidence of pericardial or pleural
 fluid. There are no mediastinal hematomas. There is extensive mediastinal
 lipomatosis. There is a small amount of fluid in the superior pericardial
 recess. There are a few small mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest one in the
 right paratracheal region measures 8 mm in short axis diameter. There is a
 nasogastric tube with tip in the stomach. The airway is patent.

 Lung windows demonstrate bilateral centrilobular emphysematous changes in the
 upper lobes. There are bibasilar dependent atelectases. There is no evidence
 of pneumothorax. There are extensive degenerative changes in the spine. There
 are several rib fractures in right anterolateral ribs extending from the 3rd
 to the 9th rib. The 7th, 8th and 9th rib fractures are displaced.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no focal liver lesions. The
 gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, right adrenal, stomach and loops of small bowel
 are unremarkable. There is a 1.2 cm nonspecific high attenuation lesion in the
 left adrenal gland. There are low attenuation peripheral lesions in bilteral
 kidneys which are too small to characterize. There is a tiny amount of fluid
 inferior to the liver. There are a few small lymph nodes in the peripancreatic

 CT HEAD W/O IV CONTRAST: Extensive high attenuation foci are scattered
 predominantly along the white and [**Doctor Last Name 180**] matter junction along the frontal high
 cerebral hemispheres are again noted.  There has been interval progression in
 both number and size of these foci.  In addition there has been marked
 interval progression of the intraventricular hemorrhage, primarily within the
 left lateral ventricle and occipital horns.  The extensive hemorrhage in the
 third ventricle and fourth ventricle is again noted.  There is possible slight
 interval enlargement in the size of the ventricles.  The old lacunar infarcts
 in the right basal ganglia and thalamus are stable.  There is extensive
 mucosal thickening in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses, increased since the
 prior study.  No fractures are identified.

 CHEST:

 INDICATION: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage. S/P intubation. Evaluate lung status
 and ETT position.

 FINDINGS: A single AP supine view. Comparison study taken 12 hours earlier on
 the same day. There is now evidence of some patchy atelectasis/infiltrate in
 the basal segment of the left lower lobe, worse than before. There is also
 probably some blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggesting a small
 effusion. Slight blunting of the right CP angle may also be present. The heart
 again shows fairly marked left ventricular enlargement. The pulmonary vessels
 show slight upper zone redistribution.

 IMPRESSION: The findings again suggest slight left ventricular failure,
 associated with left lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate. The ETT and the NG
 tube appear to be in good positions.

 UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  reevaluate intracerebral bleeding
 No contraindications for IV contrast
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 INDICATION:  Confusion; post trauma.

 TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial images of the head were obtained without intravenous
 contrast.

 COMPARISONS: CT head [**3020-11-12**].

 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  Multiple high attenuation foci along the [**Doctor Last Name 180**]-white
 matter junction are re-demonstrated, particularly in the region of the frontal
 cerebral convexities.  Bilateral subdural low attenuation collections are
 again seen measuring 9 mm in width.  The right subdural collection appears to
 have increased slightly in size. High attenuation hemorrhage layers within the
 lateral and fourth ventricles.  Some of this hemorrhage has decreased, within
 the third ventricle. Overall the lateral ventricles appear slightly smaller,
 perhaps due to slight mass effect from the subdural fluid collections. There
 is no significant shift of midline structures or mass effect. An ovoid low
 attenuation lesion within the right thalamus is consistent with a lacune. The
 intracranial carotid arteries are diffusely calcified.

 There is diffuse thickening of the mucosal surfaces within the ethmoid and
 hypoplastic maxillary sinuses.  The remaining soft tissues of the head are
 unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in size of right perifrontal subdural collection.
 Unchanged appearance of areas of shear injury and intraventricular hemorrhage
 within the lateral ventricles.  There has been a slight decrease in the size
 of the lateral ventricles and decrease in the amount of blood in the third
 ventricle.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
 UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
          66 year old man with            intraparenchymal hemmorhage, fever

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  S/P RE-INTUBATION ASSESS ET TUBE PLACEMENT
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Re-intubation, ? ETT placement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest is compared with three hours
 prior.

 FINDINGS:  Again, the patient is intubated, with the tip of the ET tube at
 approximately the thoracic inlet.  Again seen is a NG tube with tip within the
 body of the stomach. There is unchanged left ventricular enlargement with
 upper zone vascular redistribution. There has been interval improvement in the
 bilateral pleural effusions, with increased aeration of the retrocardiac area.
 Small residual effusions cannot be excluded.  No other pulmonary opacities or
 pneumothorax. Osseous structures demonstrate a mild dextroscoliosis involving
 the mid thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:

 1. Tip of the ET tube is at the thoracic inlet.

 2. Interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions, with associated
 decrease in retrocardiac atelectasis.

 3. Cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution consistent with slight failure.
